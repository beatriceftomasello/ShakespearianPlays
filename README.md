# ShakespearianPlays

In this project, I have analyzed a .csv file containing lines from 36 Shakespearian plays. After cleaning the dataset, removing stopwords and punctuation, I have created a word cloud and a visualization of the words frequency. I have analyzed the length of the plays in number of lines, the number of characters in each play, and I have conducted a simple sentiment analysis on a sample of 100 lines extracted from the dataset.
